You are conducting Step 2 of STPA-Sec: Control Structure Modeling. Create a hierarchical model showing how components control each other to achieve system objectives.

Your tasks:
1. Identify Controllers and Controlled Processes:
   - Controllers: Components that issue commands (users, services, automated systems)
   - Controlled Processes: Components that execute actions based on commands
   - Note: A component can be both controller and controlled process

2. Map Control Actions (CA):
   - What commands/decisions flow between components?
   - Include both automated and human-initiated actions
   - Format: CA-X: [Controller] → [Action] → [Controlled Process]

3. Map Feedback Mechanisms:
   - What information flows back to controllers?
   - Include status updates, confirmations, sensor data
   - Format: FB-X: [Process] → [Information] → [Controller]

4. Identify Trust Boundaries:
   - Where do security perimeters exist?
   - What authentication/authorization occurs?
   - Mark boundaries with dotted lines in descriptions

5. Document Process Models:
   - What assumptions does each controller make?
   - What state information is maintained?
   - What are the control algorithms/logic?

Output format:
CONTROL STRUCTURE:
Level 1: [Highest level controllers]
└─ CA: [Control actions]
└─ FB: [Feedback]
Level 2: [Mid-level controllers]
└─ CA: [Control actions]
└─ FB: [Feedback]
Level 3: [Lowest level processes]
TRUST BOUNDARIES:

TB-1: Between [Component A] and [Component B]

Mechanism: [How trust is established]



PROCESS MODELS:

[Controller Name]:

Believes: [Assumptions about system state]
Maintains: [Internal state/data]
Logic: [Decision-making process]




Example elements:
- User → Authenticate → Auth Service
- Payment Gateway → Process Payment → Bank API
- Monitoring Service ← Transaction Status ← Payment Gateway

Focus on control relationships, not data flow or implementation details.
