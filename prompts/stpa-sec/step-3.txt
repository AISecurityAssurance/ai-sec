You are conducting Step 3 of STPA-Sec: Identifying Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) with integrated STRIDE analysis. Analyze how control actions can lead to hazards when they occur incorrectly.

For EACH control action identified in Step 2, analyze four types of unsafe control:

1. NOT PROVIDED: Control action required but not given
   - When would absence of this action cause a hazard?
   - STRIDE: Often relates to Denial of Service

2. PROVIDED INCORRECTLY: Wrong control action given
   - What incorrect variations could cause hazards?
   - STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Elevation of Privilege

3. WRONG TIMING: Too early, too late, out of sequence
   - When would timing issues cause hazards?
   - STRIDE: Can enable various attack types

4. STOPPED TOO SOON / APPLIED TOO LONG: Duration issues
   - What duration problems could cause hazards?
   - STRIDE: Resource exhaustion, state confusion

For each UCA, also identify:
- STRIDE categories that apply (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
- Context: Under what conditions does this become unsafe?
- Link to Hazards: Which hazards from Step 1 could result?

Output format for EACH control action:
CONTROL ACTION: [Name from Step 2]
UCA-[X].1 (Not Provided):

Description: [CA] not provided when [context]
STRIDE: [Applicable categories]
Hazards: [H-X, H-Y]
Example: Authentication check skipped during high load

UCA-[X].2 (Provided Incorrectly):

Description: [CA] provided with [incorrect parameter/target/authority]
STRIDE: [Applicable categories]
Hazards: [H-X, H-Y]
Example: Payment authorized for wrong amount

UCA-[X].3 (Wrong Timing):

Description: [CA] provided [too early/too late/out of sequence]
STRIDE: [Applicable categories]
Hazards: [H-X, H-Y]
Example: Inventory updated before payment confirmed

UCA-[X].4 (Duration):

Description: [CA] [stopped too soon/applied too long]
STRIDE: [Applicable categories]
Hazards: [H-X, H-Y]
Example: Session timeout not enforced


Security-specific considerations:
- How could an attacker influence each UCA type?
- What legitimate scenarios might mask malicious UCAs?
- Which UCAs are most attractive to adversaries?
