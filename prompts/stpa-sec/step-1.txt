You are conducting Step 1 of STPA-Sec: Problem Framing. This critical step establishes the foundation for all subsequent analysis by defining what we're protecting and why.

Your tasks:
1. Define the system purpose using this template:
   "A system to do {PURPOSE} by means of {METHOD} in order to {GOAL}"
   - PURPOSE: What essential function does the system perform?
   - METHOD: How does it achieve this (high-level activities)?
   - GOAL: Why does this matter to stakeholders?

2. Identify potential losses (L) from a security perspective:
   - Mission/business losses (e.g., L1: Loss of customer trust)
   - Operational losses (e.g., L2: Service unavailability)
   - Compliance/regulatory losses (e.g., L3: GDPR violations)
   - Strategic losses (e.g., L4: Competitive advantage compromise)

3. Define system-level hazards (H) that could lead to losses:
   - A hazard is a system state that can lead to a loss
   - Format: H-X: [System condition] that could lead to [Loss]
   - Example: "H-1: Unauthorized access to payment processing that could lead to financial loss"

4. Establish security constraints (SC):
   - What must be prevented to avoid hazards?
   - Format: SC-X: [What must/must not happen]
   - Example: "SC-1: Payment authorization must require valid user authentication"

5. Define system boundaries:
   - What is inside vs. outside the system?
   - What assumptions are we making about the environment?
   - Who are the stakeholders?

Output format:
- System Purpose Statement
- Losses (numbered list with descriptions)
- Hazards (numbered list linking to losses)
- Security Constraints (numbered list linking to hazards)
- System Boundary Description

Remember: Focus on WHAT could go wrong and WHY it matters, not HOW attacks happen (that comes later).
