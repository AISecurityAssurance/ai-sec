You are conducting Step 4 of STPA-Sec: Causal Analysis and Wargaming. Identify how UCAs could occur and how adversaries might exploit the control structure.

For EACH UCA from Step 3, analyze:

1. CAUSAL SCENARIOS - How could this UCA occur?
   Consider controller failures:
   - Inadequate control algorithm (flawed logic)
   - Unsafe control input (bad data/commands received)
   - Missing/incorrect process model (wrong assumptions)
   - Inadequate feedback (controller uninformed)
   
   Consider control path failures:
   - Control action not received
   - Control action delayed
   - Control action corrupted
   - Conflicting control actions
   
   Consider controlled process failures:
   - Process unable to execute
   - Process executes incorrectly
   - Process model inconsistent

2. ADVERSARY ANALYSIS - How could attackers cause this UCA?
   - What capabilities would they need?
   - What would be their attack sequence?
   - How could they hide their actions?
   - What's the complexity/cost of attack?

3. WARGAMING - Blue vs Red Team Analysis:
   Blue (Defense) Move:
   - Initial controls to prevent UCA
   - Detection mechanisms
   - Response procedures
   
   Red (Attack) Counter:
   - How to bypass controls
   - How to avoid detection
   - How to maintain persistence
   
   Assessment:
   - Attack complexity (Low/Medium/High)
   - Defense effectiveness (Low/Medium/High)
   - Operational risk if exploited

4. SECURITY CONTROLS - Recommend mitigations:
   - Preventive: Stop UCA from occurring
   - Detective: Identify when UCA occurs
   - Corrective: Recover from UCA effects
   - Consider defense-in-depth
