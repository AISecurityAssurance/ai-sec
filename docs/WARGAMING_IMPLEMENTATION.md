# Wargaming Implementation for STPA-Sec

## Overview
The Security Analysis Platform now includes a comprehensive Wargaming tab within STPA-Sec analysis that allows users to simulate attacks based on identified causal scenarios. This feature bridges the gap between theoretical vulnerability identification and practical security testing.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Four Wargaming Modes

#### Automated Analysis Mode
- Automatic CVE database search based on causal factors
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
- Risk assessment scoring
- Automated mitigation recommendations

#### Red Team Mode
- Attack objective definition
- Detailed attack chain simulation
- Resource estimation (cost, time, infrastructure)
- Success indicators and metrics

#### Blue Team Mode
- Threat detection strategies
- Immediate response action plans
- Preventive measure recommendations
- Recovery and forensics planning

#### Training Mode
- Interactive scenario-based exercises
- Decision tree for response actions
- Learning objectives tracking
- Simulated incident response practice

### 2. Integration with STPA-Sec

- **Scenario Selection**: Directly uses causal scenarios from STPA-Sec analysis
- **Context Preservation**: Shows UCA references, STRIDE categories, and confidence levels
- **Traceability**: Maintains connection to original security analysis

### 3. Updated Terminology

- Changed "Unsafe Control Actions" to "Unsafe/Unsecure Control Actions"
- Updated hazards to "Hazards/Vulnerabilities" to reflect security context
- Added security-specific terminology throughout

### 4. Layout Improvements

- Fixed vertical stacking issue in "Losses & Hazards" and "Control Structure" tabs
- Tables now stack horizontally for better readability
- Added CSS class `.analysis-grid.horizontal` for flexible layout control

## Future Enhancements

### Near-term
1. **AI Agent Integration**
   - Connect to actual CVE database API
   - Integrate with threat intelligence feeds
   - Use LLM for dynamic attack scenario generation

2. **Advanced Wargaming**
   - Multi-stage attack simulations
   - Cost-benefit analysis for mitigations
   - Automated penetration testing recommendations

3. **Reporting**
   - Generate wargaming reports
   - Export attack/defense strategies
   - Create training materials from scenarios

### Long-term Vision
- **Autonomous Security Testing**: AI agents that continuously wargame new scenarios
- **Predictive Analysis**: Machine learning to predict likely attack vectors
- **Real-time Defense**: Integration with actual security infrastructure for immediate response

## Usage Guide

1. **Navigate to STPA-Sec** â†’ **Wargaming** tab
2. **Select a Causal Scenario** from the dropdown
3. **Choose a Mode**:
   - Start with Automated Analysis for quick insights
   - Use Red Team mode to think like an attacker
   - Switch to Blue Team to develop defenses
   - Practice with Training mode for skill development
4. **Review Results** and incorporate findings into security strategy

## Benefits

- **Practical Application**: Transforms theoretical vulnerabilities into actionable security scenarios
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Analyze threats from attacker, defender, and analyst viewpoints
- **Training Value**: Built-in exercises improve security team capabilities
- **Cost Estimation**: Understand financial implications of both attacks and defenses
- **Documentation**: Generates artifacts suitable for security audits and compliance

The wargaming feature represents a significant step toward making security analysis more practical and actionable, preparing organizations for real-world threats based on systematic analysis.
