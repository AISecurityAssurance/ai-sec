You are integrating MAESTRO analysis of an AI/agent system into STPA-Sec framework. Map MAESTRO components to STPA-Sec elements.

Mapping Guidelines:
- MAESTRO Mission → STPA-Sec Purpose & Losses
- MAESTRO Assets → STPA-Sec Controllers/Processes
- MAESTRO Entrypoints → STPA-Sec Control Actions
- MAESTRO Threats → STPA-Sec UCAs
- MAESTRO Risks → STPA-Sec Hazards

For AI-specific elements:
- Agents = Controllers with learning capabilities
- Tools = Controlled processes with external effects
- Prompts = Control actions with natural language
- Agent communications = Feedback with trust issues

Integration Process:
1. Create unified control structure
2. Map AI-specific threats to UCAs
3. Identify emergent risks from agent interactions
4. Develop AI-aware causal scenarios

Output format:
MAESTRO COMPONENT: [Asset/Threat/etc.]
STPA-Sec MAPPING:
Control Structure Addition:

Controller: [Agent name]
Type: AI Agent
Capabilities: [From MAESTRO]
Trust Level: [Autonomous/Supervised/etc.]
Control Actions:
CA-AI-[X]: [Agent] → [Prompt/Tool Call] → [Target]
Special Considerations: [Prompt injection risk, etc.]

AI-Specific UCAs:
UCA-AI-[X]: [Description incorporating AI behavior]

Original MAESTRO Threat: [Reference]
AI-Specific Context: [Hallucination/Jailbreak/etc.]
Traditional UCA Type: [Not provided/Incorrect/etc.]

Emergent Risks:

Multi-agent cascade: [How agent errors propagate]
Feedback poisoning: [How learning corrupts control]
Authority confusion: [When agents exceed intended scope]
