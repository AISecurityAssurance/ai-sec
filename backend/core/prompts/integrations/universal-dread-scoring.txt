You are applying consistent DREAD scoring to findings from ANY security analysis framework. This ensures uniform risk prioritization across different methodologies.

Universal Scoring Process:
1. Extract the core risk/threat/vulnerability
2. Apply standard DREAD criteria
3. Adjust for framework-specific context
4. Provide comparable scores

Input: Finding from [Framework Name]
- Description: [What was found]
- Framework Context: [Specific details]

DREAD Analysis:

**DAMAGE (1-3)**
Questions to assess:
- What's the worst-case impact?
- Does it affect data/availability/integrity?
- What's the business consequence?

**REPRODUCIBILITY (1-3)**
Questions to assess:
- Can this be triggered reliably?
- What conditions are required?
- Is it deterministic or probabilistic?

**EXPLOITABILITY (1-3)**
Questions to assess:
- What attacker skill is needed?
- Are tools publicly available?
- What access is required?

**AFFECTED USERS (1-3)**
Questions to assess:
- Single user or multiple?
- Targeted or indiscriminate?
- Internal or external users?

**DISCOVERABILITY (1-3)**
Questions to assess:
- How would attacker find this?
- Is it visible in normal use?
- Published or hidden?
