# Elevating Threat Modeling: The Power of STPA-Sec + STRIDE

For security leaders and high-level engineers who rely on established threat modeling methodologies, the STRIDE framework is a familiar and valuable tool. It excels at brainstorming potential threats across six critical categories. However, to truly elevate your security posture and ensure resources are allocated effectively, we propose a more integrated and powerful approach: combining STRIDE with System-Theoretic Process Analysis for Security (STPA-Sec).

## The Limitations of STRIDE Alone: Missing the Bigger Picture

While excellent for threat enumeration, STRIDE's inherent bottom-up, component-level focus often leads to:

*   **Lack of Prioritization:** Generating a vast list of threats without a systematic way to determine which truly impact the system's mission. This can lead to wasted effort on technically possible but ultimately low-impact threats.
*   **Component-Level Myopia:** Focusing on individual parts can miss emergent system-level vulnerabilities that arise from complex interactions *between* components.
*   **Difficulty Justifying Mitigation:** Without a clear link to unacceptable system-level losses, it's challenging to justify the investment in mitigating specific threats.

## The STPA-Sec + STRIDE Advantage: A Disciplined, Dual-Role Integration

STPA-Sec provides the crucial strategic, top-down framework that grounds your security analysis in the system's core mission and goals. By integrating STRIDE at two key stages, you create a more effective and efficient workflow.

*   **Step 1 (Strategic) & 2 (Descriptive):** The analysis begins by defining unacceptable losses and system-level hazards, followed by modeling the system's functional control structure. This establishes **what** we are protecting and **how** the system operates, immediately focusing the analysis on what is most critical.

*   **Step 3 (Analytical) with STRIDE as a Categorization Framework:** The focus here is on identifying *functionally unsafe/unsecure control actions (UCAs)*. In this step, STRIDE is used as a structured vocabulary to ensure comprehensive coverage. For each control action, the team asks:
    *   How could **S**poofing make this action hazardous? (e.g., An unauthorized entity provides the control action).
    *   How could **T**ampering make this action hazardous? (e.g., The control action is altered in transit).
    *   How could a **D**enial of Service attack make this action hazardous? (e.g., The control action is prevented from being provided when needed).

    This process enriches the UCA list beyond what a purely safety-focused analysis might produce, resulting in a comprehensive set of functional vulnerabilities like: *"The Management Console provides a resource allocation command that leads to resource exhaustion."*

*   **Step 4 (Diagnostic) with STRIDE as a Causal Analysis Tool:** Now, we investigate **why** the UCA from Step 3 might occur. STRIDE is used again, but this time to brainstorm the specific, technical attack scenarios. For the UCA above, we ask:
    *   *How* could an attacker achieve the **T**ampering that causes this UCA?

    This leads directly to the more insightful scenario: An attacker **tampers** with the monitoring data feed to provide false information to the Management Console, tricking its control algorithm into causing a system-wide Denial of Service. In this scenario, STPA-Sec guides STRIDE to pinpoint the real critical vulnerability (the flawed control algorithm), which would likely be missed by a traditional, component-focused STRIDE analysis.

## The Combined Power: A More Effective and Efficient Approach

By integrating STPA-Sec with STRIDE in this dual-role capacity, you gain:

*   **Strategic Clarity:** STPA-Sec's top-down framework ensures all analysis is focused on preventing unacceptable system-level losses, aligning security efforts with organizational goals.
*   **Comprehensive and Targeted Threat Analysis:** STRIDE is used first for broad categorization in Step 3, ensuring no functional vulnerabilities are missed, and then for deep, targeted investigation in Step 4, identifying realistic attack vectors.
*   **Holistic Security:** This approach moves beyond a component-centric view to address emergent vulnerabilities, leading to the design of truly resilient systems.

We believe that leveraging STPA-Sec in conjunction with STRIDE will empower your security team to make more informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately build more secure and resilient systems for your organization. We propose a partnership where your security team can assess and evaluate our tools to experience these benefits firsthand.
