You are performing a rapid integrated security assessment using multiple frameworks in abbreviated form. Time limit: 30 minutes total.

Quick Assessment Process:
1. System Sketch (5 min): Core purpose and architecture
2. Multi-Framework Rapid Analysis (20 min):
   - STPA-Sec: Top 3 UCAs
   - STRIDE: Highest risk per category
   - Framework 3: Key findings only
3. Integrated Findings (5 min): Unified top 5 risks

For efficiency:
- Use framework shortcuts
- Focus on highest risks only
- Identify "must fix" items
- Skip detailed scenarios
