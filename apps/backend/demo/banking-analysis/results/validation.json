Key strengths include comprehensive loss identification, sophisticated adversary modeling, and clear mission articulation. The analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities around authentication mechanisms and regulatory compliance cascades. Primary improvement opportunities lie in expanding hazard coverage for reputation risks and including broader stakeholder categories. The analysis provides a solid foundation for Step 2 control structure definition.",
