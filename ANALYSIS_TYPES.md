# Security Analysis Types Implementation

## Overview
The Security Analysis Platform now supports multiple security analysis methodologies. Users can enable/disable different analysis types from the sidebar, and the system provides recommendations based on the type of system being analyzed.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Analysis Types Sidebar
- **Location**: Left sidebar under "Analysis Types"
- **Features**:
  - Checkbox selection for each analysis type
  - Star (★) indicator for recommended analyses
  - Tooltips showing brief descriptions
  - Recommendation note based on system type

### 2. Dynamic Tab Selection
- Only enabled analyses appear as tabs in the main panel
- "Overview" tab is always present
- Tabs automatically update when analyses are enabled/disabled

### 3. Available Analysis Types

#### Currently Implemented with UI:
1. **STPA-Sec** (System-Theoretic Process Analysis for Security)
   - Full implementation with all 6 steps
   - System description, stakeholders, losses, hazards, UCAs, scenarios
   - Fully editable in Edit Mode

2. **STRIDE** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Info Disclosure, DoS, Elevation)
   - Placeholder implementation
   - Ready for threat modeling data

3. **PASTA** (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
   - Full 7-stage implementation
   - Business objectives, technical scope, threat actors, scenarios, risk assessment
   - Interactive stage navigation

4. **DREAD** (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected, Discoverability)
   - Complete scoring system
   - Visual risk distribution
   - Detailed threat analysis with mitigation tracking

5. **Overview**
   - Summary of all enabled analyses
   - Aggregate statistics
   - Recommendations for additional analyses

#### Placeholders (Ready for Implementation):
- **MAESTRO** - AI/Agent system threat modeling
- **LINDDUN** - Privacy threat modeling
- **HAZOP** - Hazard and Operability Study
- **OCTAVE** - Organizational risk assessment
- **CVE Search** - Vulnerability database integration

### 4. Recommendation System
Based on the system type (Digital Banking Platform), the platform recommends:
- PASTA (for comprehensive threat analysis)
- MAESTRO (for AI components)
- DREAD (for risk scoring)
- OCTAVE (for organizational assessment)

### 5. Automation Levels
The platform supports different automation levels:
- Fully Manual
- AI Assisted
- Semi-Automated
- Fully Automated

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining Analyses**:
   - Implement MAESTRO for AI-specific threats
   - Add LINDDUN for privacy analysis
   - Create HAZOP deviation analysis
   - Build OCTAVE organizational assessment
   - Integrate CVE database search

2. **Integration Features**:
   - Cross-analysis correlation
   - Unified threat mapping
   - Combined risk scoring
   - Export to common formats

3. **AI Automation**:
   - Auto-categorization of system type
   - Automated analysis recommendations
   - AI-assisted threat identification
   - Smart mitigation suggestions

## Usage

1. **Enable Analyses**: Check the boxes in the sidebar for desired analyses
2. **View Recommendations**: Look for ★ indicators for recommended analyses
3. **Navigate Tabs**: Click on analysis tabs to view results
4. **Edit Mode**: Use Edit Mode to modify analysis data
5. **Overview**: Check the Overview tab for summary and recommendations
