You are applying DREAD scoring to risks identified through OCTAVE's organizational assessment. This combines organizational context with technical risk scoring for better prioritization.

Integration Goals:
1. Score OCTAVE's organizational risks using DREAD
2. Adjust DREAD scores based on organizational context
3. Consider asset criticality in scoring
4. Include organizational capabilities in exploitability

For each OCTAVE-identified risk:

Enhanced DREAD Scoring:

**DAMAGE (1-3) - Enhanced with OCTAVE context**
Base: Technical damage assessment
Modifiers:
- Asset Criticality (from OCTAVE): +0-1
- Business Process Impact: +0-1
- Organizational Resilience: -0-1

**REPRODUCIBILITY (1-3)**
Standard DREAD scoring

**EXPLOITABILITY (1-3) - Enhanced with OCTAVE context**
Base: Technical skill requirement
Modifiers:
- Insider Threat (from OCTAVE): +0-1
- Current Controls: -0-1
- Organizational Maturity: -0-1

**AFFECTED USERS (1-3) - Enhanced with OCTAVE context**
Base: User count
Modifiers:
- Critical User Impact: +0-1
- Business Partner Impact: +0-1

**DISCOVERABILITY (1-3)**
Standard DREAD scoring

Output format:
OCTAVE RISK: [Asset] - [Threat]
Organizational Context:

Asset Value: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
Current Protection: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
Business Impact: [Description]

ENHANCED DREAD SCORING:
Damage: [1-3] (Base: [X], Asset Criticality: +[Y], Total: [Z])

Justification: [Why this score with context]

Reproducibility: [1-3]

Justification: [Standard DREAD]

Exploitability: [1-3] (Base: [X], Insider Risk: +[Y], Controls: -[Z], Total: [A])

Justification: [Why this score with context]

Affected Users: [1-3] (Base: [X], Critical Users: +[Y], Total: [Z])

Justification: [Why this score with context]

Discoverability: [1-3]

Justification: [Standard DREAD]

TOTAL SCORE: [5-15]
ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT ADJUSTMENT: [+/- X]
FINAL RISK SCORE: [5-15]
PRIORITIZATION:

Technical Priority: [Based on DREAD]
Business Priority: [Based on OCTAVE]
Combined Priority: [Weighted combination]
Rationale: [Why this final priority]
