# Backend Ideas 

# Colleague's ask
A couple of things we can think about adding:
For the testing arena I like the idea of testing multiple variants but I also think it could be call if you could switch the backing LLM you were testing with. Maybe we keep that as a separate option so it doesn't get confusing

In the same vein as the variants it would be cool if we had a versioning system so that the analysis could be realtime, within a couple of seconds after submitting. That way you could also version the inputs and the threat models. For that as well we would need like a beginning flow which is where you upload your architecture diagram, textual description, etc
