# Step 2 Implementation Fix Summary

## Problem
The "column 'identifier' does not exist" error was preventing Step 2 from running, even though the column was defined in the migration schema.

## Root Cause
The Step 2 tables were not being created properly in existing databases when using the `--use-database` flag.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Updated CLI Migration Check** (cli.py:1834-1842)
   - Changed from information_schema check to direct query test
   - Runs force rebuild migration if identifier column is missing

2. **Created Force Rebuild Migration** (019_step2_force_rebuild.sql)
   - Drops all Step 2 tables except step2_analyses
   - Recreates all tables with proper schema including identifier column

3. **Manual Migration Process**
   - For existing databases, run migrations in order:
     - 016_step2_control_structure.sql
     - 017_step2_fixes.sql  
     - 019_step2_force_rebuild.sql

## Verification
Successfully verified that:
- ✅ Step 2 tables are created with correct schema
- ✅ system_components table has identifier column
- ✅ All required columns are present

## Next Steps
1. Test Step 2 with proper Azure OpenAI credentials
2. Implement Step 2 output visualization
3. Continue with Step 3 implementation

## Database Used for Testing
- Database: `stpa_analysis_20250730_203143`
- Step 1 Analysis ID: `b0b721af-9671-44a6-ad6c-6df35e6fc05c`
