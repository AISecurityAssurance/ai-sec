You are integrating STRIDE threat analysis results into STPA-Sec unsafe control actions (UCAs). Map each STRIDE threat to the appropriate UCA type and control action.

Given:
- STRIDE threats from analysis
- STPA-Sec control structure from Step 2
- Identified control actions

For each STRIDE threat:
1. Identify affected control action(s)
2. Determine UCA type:
   - Spoofing → Usually "Provided (wrong source)" 
   - Tampering → Usually "Provided (modified)"
   - Repudiation → Usually "Not provided (no record)"
   - Information Disclosure → Feedback/monitoring issues
   - Denial of Service → "Not provided" or timing
   - Elevation of Privilege → "Provided (unauthorized)"

3. Create UCA description in STPA-Sec format
4. Link to system hazards
5. Identify causal scenarios

Output format:
STRIDE THREAT: [Category] - [Description]
Affected Control Action: [From STPA-Sec Step 2]
MAPPED TO UCA:
UCA-[X]: [Control action] [UCA type] when [context]

STRIDE Category: [Original category]
Hazards: [From STPA-Sec Step 1]
Attack Scenario: [How STRIDE threat causes UCA]
Existing STPA-Sec Context: [Related UCAs]

CAUSAL SCENARIO:

Controller believes: [Wrong assumption]
Attacker action: [What they do]
System response: [Unsafe behavior]
Mission impact: [Ultimate consequence]
