Great.  I see the changes in the SA chat.  Everything is working. Looks good.

Next. Consider the following use case:
A user opens the STPA-Sec plugin in a new window. They like the dropdowns with the initial collapsed because they can quickly see an overview of all the sections available.  Next, the user wants to look at, for example the Control Diagram in a separate window and the System Description in another window.  They may also want to look at any one (or more) of the other sections in a separate window.  Users will often be analyze a variety of plugins, sections, subsections, tables, etc in separate windows.  We'll need to provide that full flexibility to move any plugin, section, subsection, table, or diagram to a separate window/tab.  (Sort of like a computer programmer is typically working in multiple windows and tabs).  Let's add this functionality.

# TODO
Here's what I have in mind.
While future plugins should be able to create their own format, which we can just render as plugin that appears as the user defined in the Analysis Canvas, it's better if we create importable templates that handle tables, sections, and so on.  Each template should be wrapped in a "container" (or whatever works) with a "Edit", "Cancel" (i.e., cancel changes), "Save", and "Export" button.  Plugins can use these templates to define their plugin (the could also ask some other LLM to format their plugin so it fits in our template.  We could provide a detailed description of the template that an LLM could understand.  Perhaps we will set up our app with an MCP server to provide format information to an MCP client...we'll do this later.  For now, we want to document the analysis plugin structure so that a developer can provide the instructions to an LLM to format their plugin. )

# Template
## New window/tab using the browser's native tab/window functionality
- Each section, subsection, subsubsection, etc should use the browser's native tab/window functionality.
- This should be a feature of the plugin template containers.

## Plugin template container funcitons
In addition to opening in a new tab/window. Each section, subsection, subsubsection, etc (let's call this analysis components)should have the following functions:
<Edit>
The Edit button makes the text, cells, diagram, or whatever editable.
<Cancel>
The Cancel button cancels edit changes, restoring the pre-edited state.
<Save>
The Save button save the edits.
<Export>
The Export button allows users to export just this section (i.e., if it's a table, they may want to export it as a csv, json, or other format.  If it's a diagram, they may want to export this as a png, svg, or other format.)


# Next steps 
Let's build the template for the analysis plugins and use our demo to display, test, and modify them.  Do you have any questions?

 1. Container hierarchy: Yes.  Whenever possible,  every level (plugin, section, subsection, table) have its own Edit/Cancel/Save/Export buttons
  2. Edit scope: Yes. Let's make all it's children editable hen a user clicks Edit on a section
  as well?
  3. Export formats: For the Export button:
    - YES.  Auto-detect appropriate formats based on content type (table→CSV/JSON, diagram→PNG/SVG).
    - We could also have a default set of formats in case the developer does not design them into their component.
  4. State management: YES.  Absolutely.  opening in a new window, edits in one window sync to other windows showing the same content
  5. Template structure: YES.  we should create separate templates for:
    - AnalysisSection (collapsible sections)
    - AnalysisTable (data tables)
    - AnalysisDiagram (flow charts, diagrams)
    - AnalysisText (narrative content)



More few fixes:
# General issues
- When I right-click a section, subsection, table, or diagram and open in a new window/tab it's blank. 
- For wide tables, they may extend beyond the container (especially in smaller windows).  Add a horizontal scroll bar.

# STPA-SEC
## System Description
- I see Stakeholders in the System Description section.  We don't need this because we already have a Stakeholders section with the Stakeholders Analysis (keep this. instead.)
- I don't see the "Full System Description" section that was in the previous version.  Add this.

## Control Flow Diagram
- This is blank.  Add the control flow diagram using React Flow.

## Wargaming
The previous version allowed the user to click on an exercise and it broke it done in a new section below the table.  Add this functionality.  

## DREAD
In Risk Analysis Charts, set the Risk Distribution and Threats by category side-by-side.  Convert the Threats by Category into a bar chart. 

## Missing Plugin Details
The following components still have placeholders for the analysis.  Fill them in with the information from the previous version of the app: STRIDE, PASTA, MAESTRO, LINDDUN, HAZOP, OCTAVE

Do you have any questions?


- Add the system control flow diagram (see previous version) using React Flow
- The previous iteration had more tables for stakeholders: primary, secondary, threat actors. Add these.
- The wargamming sections had much more in the previous iteration: Red Teaming, Blue Teaming, and two more (what were they?)
- In the previous version, clicking on some of the table rows showed addition information about that element.  For example, clicking on a wargaming scenario and which other ones?  Let's add this. 

# DREAD
- Add the Risk Distribution Chart.  There were several charts in the previous iteration.  Let's add those. 


# Summary
We liked the look of the previous version's plugins.  However, we wanted to overhaul the UI and create plugin-based versions.  Now that we've overhaulled the UI and created plugins based on these templates, we want to convert the previous versions of all existing analysis plugins to the current set up.  This includes STRIDE, PASTA, MAESTRO, LINDDUN, HAZAOP, AND OCTAVE, as well as the full STPA-Sec, and DREAD.  Diagrams included.  Let's keep iterating on the conversions of the previous analysis plugins to our current UI using the new template plugin structures.  If you need to create new templates for the plugins, go ahead and do that.
