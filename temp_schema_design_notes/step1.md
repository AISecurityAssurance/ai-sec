Step 1: Problem Framing for Banking System

  Problem Statement Format:

  "A System to do {What = Purpose} by means of {How = Method} in order to contribute to {Why = Goals}"

  Our Banking System Problem Frame:

  "A System to provide secure digital banking services BY MEANS OF authenticating users, authorizing transactions, detecting fraud, and
  protecting customer data IN ORDER TO enable customers to manage their finances while maintaining trust, regulatory compliance, and
  preventing financial losses"

  Define Losses (What we're trying to prevent):

  L1: Customer Financial Loss
  - Unauthorized transactions
  - Account takeover
  - Fraudulent transfers
  - Direct monetary impact

  L2: Regulatory Non-Compliance
  - GDPR/PCI-DSS violations
  - Audit failures
  - Operating license suspension
  - Fines and sanctions

  L3: Loss of Customer Trust/Business Reputation
  - Mass customer exodus
  - Media coverage of breaches
  - Loss of market position
  - Long-term business impact

  L4: Service Unavailability
  - Customers unable to access funds
  - Business operations disrupted
  - Emergency situations unhandled
  - Revenue loss

  L5: Loss of Sensitive Information
  - Customer PII exposure
  - Business intelligence theft
  - Competitive disadvantage
  - Identity theft enablement

  Define System-Level Hazards (conditions that can lead to losses):

  H1: System allows unauthorized financial transactions [L1, L3]
  - Weak authentication bypassed
  - Authorization checks fail
  - Session hijacking successful

  H2: System exposes customer data to unauthorized parties [L2, L3, L5]
  - Data breach occurs
  - Improper access controls
  - Unencrypted data transmission

  H3: Critical banking services become unavailable [L3, L4]
  - DoS attack successful
  - System overload
  - Cascading failures

  H4: System fails to detect/prevent fraudulent activity [L1, L2, L3]
  - Fraud patterns missed
  - AI system compromised
  - Insider threats undetected

  H5: Audit trail can be tampered with or is incomplete [L2, L5]
  - Logs deleted/modified
  - Actions not recorded
  - Timeline reconstruction impossible

  Mission Context & Success Criteria:

  Primary Mission: Enable secure, reliable digital banking for 5M+ customers

  Success Metrics:
  - Transaction Availability: 99.99% uptime
  - Fraud Prevention: <0.01% fraudulent transaction rate
  - Regulatory Compliance: 100% audit pass rate
  - Customer Trust: >90% satisfaction score

  Operational Context:
  - 10M+ transactions daily
  - $10B+ in assets under management
  - Hybrid cloud deployment
  - 24/7 global operations
  - Real-time transaction processing

  Key Stakeholders & Their Concerns:

  1. Customers (Primary)
    - Need: Secure access to funds
    - Fear: Financial loss, identity theft
  2. Bank Business (Primary)
    - Need: Profitable operations
    - Fear: Reputation damage, regulatory fines
  3. Regulators (Primary)
    - Need: Compliance verification
    - Fear: Systemic risk, consumer harm
  4. Employees (Secondary)
    - Need: Usable systems
    - Fear: Being blamed for breaches

  Adversary Perspective (Critical for STPA-Sec):

  Key Insight: Adversaries must solve their own control problem to achieve their goals

  Adversary Goals:
  1. Steal money (direct financial gain)
  2. Steal data (sell on dark web)
  3. Disrupt service (competitive advantage/ransom)
  4. Damage reputation (activism/revenge)

  Adversary Control Problem:
  - Observe: What can they see? (public APIs, error messages, timing)
  - Orient: What do they understand? (system behavior, patterns)
  - Decide: What attack to launch? (based on capabilities)
  - Act: Execute the attack (using their resources)

  Why This Problem Framing Matters:

  1. Strategic Focus: We're not just "preventing hacks" - we're protecting the banking mission
  2. Measurable Outcomes: Clear success criteria linked to business goals
  3. Adversarial Thinking: Recognizes attackers as intelligent agents solving problems
  4. Holistic View: Includes all stakeholders, not just technical considerations
  5. Context-Aware: Captures operational realities (scale, criticality, regulations)

  This problem framing sets the foundation for:
  - Step 2: Modeling the control structure with these stakeholders and goals in mind
  - Step 3: Identifying UCAs that could lead to these specific hazards
  - Step 4: Developing scenarios considering adversary capabilities
  - Wargaming: Testing our assumptions about adversary behavior

  The key difference from traditional security analysis is that we START with mission impact and work backwards to technical
  vulnerabilities, rather than starting with vulnerabilities and trying to imagine impacts.
